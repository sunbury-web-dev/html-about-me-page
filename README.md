# 📝 Week 3 Lab - HTML About Me Page

A template repostiory for practicing HTML by creating an informational page about yourself using standard HTML boilerplate and tags.

## Goal

Students can build a single webpage demonstrating their understanding of the following HTML tags:

* `<html>`
* `<meta>`
* `<head>`
* `<title>`
* `<body>`
* `<h1>`
* `<p>`
* `<strong>`
* `<em>`
* `<ul>`
* `<ol>`
* `<li>`
* `<a>`
* `<img>`

We'll also look for the following:

* a `lang` attribute is added to their `<html>` declaration
* a `charset` attribute is added to their `<meta>` declaration
* all `<img>` tags have an `alt` attribute
